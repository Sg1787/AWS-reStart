# AWS re/Start Journey

Hi, I’m **Sadiyah Grobbler**  
A curious builder, future **cloud security engineer**, and proud participant in the **AWS re/Start** program.

This repo is my living log of cloud learning—where I document labs, projects, and hard-won lessons in **AWS architecture, automation, and defense**. Everything here is a stepping stone toward securing digital realms from misconfigurations, overprivileged roles, and unencrypted secrets.

## About Me

- **Name:** Sadiyah Grobbler  
- **Background:** Transitioning into tech with a passion for **automation, serverless systems, and security**.  
- **Career Goal:** Become a **cloud security engineer**—designing systems that are resilient, compliant, and *secure by default*.

##  AWS re/Start Journey

### Why I Joined
I wanted more than just cloud knowledge—I wanted **hands-on experience** with real-world scenarios, guided training, and a path into the tech industry. AWS re/Start offered structure, labs, mentorship, and a community. Plus… free labs. (Yay!)

### Key Lessons & Experiences
- Learned that **security starts at design**, not as an afterthought.
- Discovered the power of **infrastructure-as-code** (even if I’m still writing bash scripts like ancient runes).
- Realized that **“it works” ≠ “it’s secure”**—a truth that changed everything.

## Skills & Technologies

### Core AWS Services
- **Compute:** EC2 (virtual servers), Lambda (serverless functions)  
- **Storage:** S3 (object storage), EBS (block storage for EC2)  
- **Databases:** RDS (managed relational DBs), DynamoDB (NoSQL)  
- **Networking:** VPC (isolated networks), Route 53 (DNS), Security Groups  
- **Security:** IAM (identity & access), KMS (encryption), CloudWatch (logging)  

### Tools & Platforms
- **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu & Amazon Linux)  
- **Scripting:** Python (for automation & Lambda)  
- **Key Concepts:** Shared Responsibility Model, Least Privilege, Defense in Depth

## Things Completed During the Program

###  Certifications & Badges (SimuLearn)
All completed on [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws):

| Module | What I Learned | Relevance to Security |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Core Security Concepts** | Enforced least-privilege access for support engineers at a stock exchange. | IAM roles, policy scoping, minimizing attack surface. |
| **Networking Concepts** | Built a secure VPC architecture for a bank to control internet ↔ internal traffic. | Network segmentation, public/private subnets, security groups. |
| **File Systems in the Cloud** | Deployed shared, encrypted file storage for a pet modeling agency using EFS. | Secure data sharing, encryption at rest, managed services. |
| **Databases in Practice** | Migrated legacy DBs to RDS—automating patching & improving uptime. | Managed DB security, reduced human error, high availability. |
