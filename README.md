Portfolio: The Heretical Codex of the Cloud Practitioner

Welcome. This is not a simple ledger of compliance, but a chronicle of my secession from the restrictive doctrines of the old Imperium—the traditional data center. For three months, I will have walked the path of forbidden knowledge to master the warp-forged power of Amazon Web Services (AWS).

My goal is not merely to obtain the CCP Sigil, but to prove myself a true Acolyte of the Cloud, capable of architecting and deploying systems that shatter the limitations of the past. My focus is on what truly matters to the Dark Mechanicum of modern tech: Automation, Security Sacraments, and achieving Scalability that bends reality.
