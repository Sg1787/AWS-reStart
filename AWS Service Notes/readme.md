# Service Notes & Documentation  
### *“A well-rotted system is a well-understood system.”*  
> — **Grandfather Nurgle**, probably while debugging a Lambda timeout

Welcome, weary traveler of the cloud!  
This repo is your **grimoire of digital decay**—a living, breathing (and occasionally oozing) knowledge base for everything from AWS spells to Linux incantations.

Don’t just fix things—**understand the rot**, document the cure, and let your systems fester *intentionally*.

---

## How This Knowledge Grows

Notes are organized like a plague garden—by **domain**, so you can find the right mold quickly:

- ** Cloud Services** (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
  → Config snippets, best practices, and rituals for summoning servers.
  
- **Networking**  
  → VPCs, firewalls, and the sacred art of *not* exposing your database to the entire internet.
  
- ** Operating Systems** (Linux, Windows)  
  → Commands to harden, heal, and occasionally scream at your servers.
  
- ** Troubleshooting**  
  → Step-by-step cures for common plagues (e.g., “Why is my S3 bucket screaming?”).

> *"A problem undocumented is a problem waiting to return—angrier, hungrier, and with friends."*

## AWS Services: The Plagues of the Cloud

Behold! The sacred services that keep your digital empire from collapsing into beautiful, chaotic sludge.

| Code | Service | Nurgle’s Translation | Real Use |
|------|--------|------------------------|--------|
| **EC2** | Elastic Compute Cloud | *"Flesh-puppets of computation"* | Virtual servers—your digital golems. |
| **S3** | Simple Storage Service | *"The Infinite Rotting Chest"* | Store files, backups, cat memes. Forever. |
| **RDS** | Relational Database Service | *"The Beating Heart (in a Jar)"* | Managed databases—no DBA required (but still hire one). |
| **Lambda** | AWS Lambda | *"Spirits that act, then vanish"* | Run code without managing servers. Poof! Gone! |
| **IAM** | Identity & Access Mgmt | *"Who may touch the sacred mold?"* | Control who can do what. **Least privilege or bust!** |
| **CloudWatch** | Amazon CloudWatch | *"The All-Seeing Pustule"* | Monitor metrics, logs, and screams of your apps. |
| **VPC** | Virtual Private Cloud | *"Your walled garden of decay"* | A private, secure network in AWS. No peasants allowed. |
| **ECS/EKS** | Container Services | *"Swarm-bearers of micro-rot"* | Run Docker containers like a true plague lord. |
| **SNS** | Simple Notification Service | *"The Crier of Doom"* | Send alerts via email, SMS, carrier pigeon. |
| **SQS** | Simple Queue Service | *"The Goo That Binds Services"* | Let apps talk asynchronously—no shouting required. |
| **CLI** | AWS Command Line | *"Whispers to the Machine God"* | Control AWS from your terminal like a dark wizard. |
| **CloudFormation** | AWS CloudFormation | *"The Scroll of Rebirth"* | Define your infra as code—so it may rise again after collapse. |
