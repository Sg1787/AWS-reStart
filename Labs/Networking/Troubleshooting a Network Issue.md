# Debugging the Unreachable Apache Server

## The Cry for Help

Sound familiar? This was a classic AWS networking riddle—and my chance to play cloud exorcist.

##  Steps I Took to Slay the Digital Daemon

### 1. **SSH’d into the EC2 Instance**
First things first: I needed eyes on the machine.  
Using the provided `.pem` key, I connected via:
```bash
ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@<PUBLIC_IP>
```
No drama—just clean access. (Khorne was unimpressed. Too peaceful for his taste.)

### 2. **Checked if Apache Was Even Awake**
Ran:
```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd.service

```

Output? **Inactive (dead)**.  
Ah—so the server wasn’t running at all!  


I revived it with:
```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd.service
```

Now `httpd` was alive… but still invisible to the outside world.

### 3. **Tested Browser Access → Silence**
Typed `http://<ip10-0-10-51>` into my browser.  
**Blank screen. No error. Just void.**  

That told me: the service works *locally*, but **something’s blocking inbound traffic**.

---

### 4. **Verified Outbound Connectivity**
From the EC2 instance:
```bash
ping amazon.com
```
 Success! So the **Internet Gateway**, **route table**, and **public subnet** were all configured correctly.  
The instance could *reach out*—but the world couldn’t reach *in*.

### 5. **Hunted the Real Culprit: The Security Group**
I opened the **VPC Console** and inspected layer by layer:
- Internet Gateway: Attached  
- Route Table: `0.0.0.0/0` → igw-xxxx
<img width="1885" height="324" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d22caffc-7274-438a-96ad-33b7b2d32240" />

- Subnet: Public (routed to IGW)  
- **Security Group**: Only allowed **port 22 (SSH)**  

**No rule for HTTP (port 80)!**  
That’s why the browser got ghosted.

---

### 6. **Added the Missing Rule**
I edited the Security Group and added:
- **Type**: HTTP  
- **Protocol**: TCP  
- **Port**: 80  
- **Source**: *(lab-only! In prod, I’d lock this down)*

---

### 7. **Victory: The Apache Page Appeared!**
Refreshed the browser—**Apache test page loaded instantly**. 🎉  
Light returned to the Realm of AWS.

## Key Takeaways (Without the Chaos)

- **Security Groups are stateful firewalls**—they **deny all inbound by default**.
- **Ping uses ICMP**, which is **not allowed by default** in AWS—so “can’t ping” is normal! Focus on **port 80/443** for web.
- Always verify the **Security Group** before blaming routing, subnets, or the fickle gods of latency.

## Final Thought

Cloud troubleshooting isn’t just about commands—it’s about **curiosity, methodical checks, and a healthy distrust of default settings**.  

And sometimes? You’re not just fixing a server.  
You’re **banishing a minor Warp entity disguised as a missing firewall rule**.
