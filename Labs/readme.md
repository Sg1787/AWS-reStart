#  Hands-on Labs Portfolio  
*Chaos-tested. Cloud-built.*

This repo logs my real-world labs in AWS—because **resilience is earned in the fire of failure** (and maybe a little Nurgle-approved decay).

##  What’s Here
- **AWS labs**: EC2, S3, Lambda, VPC, IAM, RDS  
- **Security & automation**: Python scripts, IAM policies, secure architectures  
- **Chaos experiments**: Breaking things on purpose—so they learn to heal  
- **Cert prep**: For AWS Cloud Practitioner & Solutions Architect  

##  Why It Matters  
I’m in **AWS re/Start**, building toward a career in **cloud security**. These labs prove I don’t just learn—I **break, rebuild, and harden**.
