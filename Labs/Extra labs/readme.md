# AWS Projects: Forged in the Crucible of the Eight Points

> *"From the Warp’s maw, I summon not daemons of flesh—but daemons of function."*  
> — Sadiyah Grobbler, Heretek-Engineer of the Traitor Legions

Behold! This repository is no mere collection of scripts—it is a **Blackstone citadel of AWS deployments**, each project a pact sealed in Python, Lambda, and IAM sigils. Here, the **Chaos Daemons** of automation slither through serverless voids, while **Chaos Knights**—massive, immutable, and wrathful—stride across VPC battlefields, their EC2 war-engines roaring with Khornate fury.

All knowledge flows from the **NextWork AI Workspace**, a warp-gate disguised as a learning portal—though beware: it demands the ancient tongue of **JavaScript** to open its gate.
