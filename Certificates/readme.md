#  My AWS Certifications & Training Log 
*“Plagues of knowledge, rot of ignorance—only the prepared shall thrive in the cloud.”*  
— Nurgle, probably, if he used AWS

Welcome to my growing collection of AWS achievements! This repo chronicles my journey through the **AWS re/Start** program—where I'm learning to summon the powers of the cloud, secure systems like a fortress, and automate away the mundane (so I never have to manually patch a database again... praise the Cloud Gods).

## About AWS re/Start

AWS re/Start is a free, intensive training program that equips learners like me with **cloud computing skills**, **hands-on labs**, and career prep to launch into tech roles. Think of it as boot camp… but with more IAM policies and fewer push-ups (though sometimes debugging VPCs feels like both).

## Certificates of Completion

I’ve conquered the following **SimuLearn scenarios**—interactive, story-driven labs that feel like cloud-themed choose-your-own-adventures (but with real AWS architecture).

| Module | Scenario Summary | Certification |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
|  **[Core Security Concepts](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/3KYWQBTSTV/aws-simulearn-core-security-concepts/Q29T2DWZPK)** | Helped a stock exchange implement **least-privilege access** for support engineers—because nobody needs `AdministratorAccess` to reboot a printer. | <img width="920" height="709" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24b0bcc4-5c86-4972-9b50-9b3ac9adae62" />|
|  **[Networking Concepts](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/XCEMH2NXKJ/aws-simulearn-networking-concepts/QN5P4AJMUV)** | Designed a **secure network architecture** for a bank so their internal resources don’t accidentally gossip with the whole internet. | <img width="789" height="598" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40e9cc1-3949-440f-bf9f-e7b1d253cc49" />|
|  **[File Systems in the Cloud](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/A5M8X2CHM3/aws-simulearn-file-systems-in-the-cloud/RAJVAUNMHR)** | Built a shared file system for a **pet modeling agency** (yes, really)—so fluffy clients’ portfolios sync across branches without physical servers. | <img width="874" height="623" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f8eb0ca-6cf3-4769-84a6-d9230b695b0b" />|
|  **[Databases in Practice](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/6VTV7UQ6CY/aws-simulearn-databases-in-practice/3M6ZTC32MX)** | Freed an insurance company’s DBAs from patching purgatory using **managed databases**—more uptime, less toil, maximum efficiency. | <img width="1005" height="709" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9f97a69-1743-47be-a2ad-52d22d1250d1" />|

##  Next Steps & Goals

My cloud journey is far from over—every certification is a rune of protection, etched into the grimoire of my career. My path is clear:

- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** – The sacred first step: mastering AWS fundamentals with a watchful eye on security best practices.
- **AWS Certified Developer – Associate** – Learning to build **secure, serverless applications** with least-privilege roles, encrypted storage, and secure CI/CD pipelines.
- **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional** – Designing cloud architectures that are not just scalable and resilient—but **secure by default**, from VPCs to IAM to data flows.
- **AWS Certified Security – Specialty** – The ultimate consecration. Deep mastery of threat detection, encryption, identity governance, network defenses, and compliance in the cloud.

##  Final Words

This repo isn’t just a trophy case—it’s a **living log** of my transformation from “What’s a subnet?” to “Ah, yes, let’s design a multi-AZ, encrypted, auto-healing architecture before breakfast.”

Feel free to explore, learn with me, or send memes about IAM policies gone wrong.

*May your deployments be green, your logs be clean, and your access keys never leak.*  
 **Praise Nurgle. Praise Cloud.**
